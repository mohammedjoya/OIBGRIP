Web Development Tasks

My name is Joya Muskan and I declared that all the data added to this repository is created and edited by me.

This repository contains all tasks of Web development and design internship (Level 2) given by Oasis Infobyte.

- Task 1 is a calculator. It takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic mathematical functionalities using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Calculators require an interactive interface to perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. It has a display screen to display the user’s input and give the results.
- Task 2 is a tribute page. With a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, I easily created a page for someone I admire. Write about the person, add images, gave an appealing layout, used paragraphs appropriately. I also played around with different font styles and background colors.
- Task 3 is a To-do-list. The to-do web app allows users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list must be visible. Also, a user can mark a task “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks must appear on a separate list, say Completed Tasks.




I would like to thank Oasis Infobyte for providing me with this internship which gave me an opportunity to learn and grow my knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript. This internship helped me to enhance my employability prospects and raise my confidence.
