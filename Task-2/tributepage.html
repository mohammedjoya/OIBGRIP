        <p style="text-align:left;">
            Mother Teresa (1910–1997) was a Roman Catholic nun who devoted her life to serving the poor and destitute around the world. She spent many years in Calcutta, India where she founded the Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation devoted to helping those in great need. In 1979, Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and became a symbol of charitable, selfless work. In 2016, Mother Teresa was canonised by the Roman Catholic Church as Saint Teresa.Mother Teresa was born in 1910 in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia. Little is known about her early life, but at a young age, she felt a calling to be a nun and serve through helping the poor. At the age of 18, she was given permission to join a group of nuns in Ireland. After a few months of training, with the Sisters of Loreto, she was then given permission to travel to India. She took her formal religious vows in 1931 and chose to be named after St Therese of Lisieux – the patron saint of missionaries.

            On her arrival in India, she began by working as a teacher; however, the widespread poverty of Calcutta made a deep impression on her, and this led to her starting a new order called “The Missionaries of Charity”. The primary objective of this mission was to look after people, who nobody else was prepared to look after. Mother Teresa felt that serving others was a fundamental principle of the teachings of Jesus Christ.

        Mother Teresa said, "By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to my calling, I belong to the world. As to my heart, I belong entirely to the Heart of Jesus." Fluent in five languages – Bengali, Albanian, Serbian, English and Hindi – she made occasional trips outside India for humanitarian reasons.

        At the height of the Siege of Beirut in 1982, Mother Teresa rescued 37 children trapped in a front-line hospital by brokering a temporary cease-fire between the Israeli army and Palestinian guerrillas. Accompanied by Red Cross workers, she travelled through the war zone to the hospital to evacuate the young patients.
        
        When Eastern Europe experienced increased openness in the late 1980s, Mother Teresa expanded her efforts to Communist countries which had rejected the Missionaries of Charity. She began dozens of projects, undeterred by criticism of her stands against abortion and divorce: "No matter who says what, you should accept it with a smile and do your own work." She visited Armenia after the 1988 earthquake and met with Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov.
        
        Mother Teresa travelled to assist the hungry in Ethiopia, radiation victims at Chernobyl and earthquake victims in Armenia. In 1991 she returned to Albania for the first time, opening a Missionaries of Charity Brothers home in Tirana.
        
        By 1996, the Missionaries of Charity operated 517 missions in over 100 countries.The number of sisters in the Missionaries of Charity grew from twelve to thousands, serving the "poorest of the poor" in 450 centres worldwide. The first Missionaries of Charity home in the United States was established in the South Bronx area of New York City, and by 1984 the congregation operated 19 establishments throughout the country.</p>

    <h2 class="head" id="section4">Mother Teresa and the Controversy</h2>
    <p>In 1970-1980, Mother Teresa had become the Global Icon. The Hindus and critics believed that Teresa was spreading Christianity and raising the number of Christians in her Mission in India and other Asian countries like Nepal, Pakistan, Srilanka, Bhutan, etc. She was extremely criticized by the journalist, Hindus, and another nationalist.

        The mission of the Missionaries of Charity is not to help the poor and needy people, but to propagate religion and spread Christianity.That was the only purpose of her institution.
        
        Many believed that Mother Teresa was an orthodox woman who worked for the church and Christianity.Many journalists and critics even said that in the name of charitable work, Teresa and her institution areconverting people's religion.
        
        People even say that there was no medical expert or staff in their charitable homes and they did not even have pain killer pills.She used to leave people and their illnesses to Jesus.
        
        Well, this is also true, that most funding of Missionaries of Charity has come from Foreign Countries. And these countries had dominated Christian religion.</p>
